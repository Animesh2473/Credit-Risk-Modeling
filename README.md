Here is a **beautifully documented README.md** for your project, which covers the app (https://loan-risk-analyzer.streamlit.app/), the technology stack, features, stepwise workflow, and a best-practices file structure.

# Loan Risk Analyzer 🚦

An interactive web application for **Credit Risk Bias & Fairness Detection**, allowing users to analyze, predict, and mitigate bias in credit risk modeling with powerful visualizations and explainability. 

🔗 **Live App:** [https://loan-risk-analyzer.streamlit.app/](https://loan-risk-analyzer.streamlit.app/)

***

## ✨ Features

- **Upload Dataset:** Instantly visualize predictions, group risk rates, and fairness metrics from your CSV.
- **Manual Entry & Scoring:** Enter applicant details in a form and receive an instant risk score using a real ML model.
- **Bias & Fairness Analysis:** See group-wise bias before and after mitigation using Demographic Parity and Equalized Odds.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Enjoy dynamic Plotly charts, ROC curves, and classified performance tables.
- **Explainability Ready:** (Optional) Integrate SHAP for model transparency (local/global impact explanations).
- **Clean Portfolio Design:** Responsive, intuitive UI, perfect for demonstrations or practical decision science.

***

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/):** Modern Python app framework for data apps.
- **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/):** Model development; includes logistic regression, scaling, and metrics.
- **[Fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/):** Open-source library for measuring and mitigating bias in ML.
- **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/):** Interactive and publication-ready charts.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and computation.
- **Pickle:** For saving and loading trained pipelines and scalers.
- **SHAP** and/or **LIME:** For explainable AI if desired.

## 🏆 Project Workflow
Data Preparation: Load, clean, explore CSVs (Data/)

Feature Engineering: Transform, scale, encode data (see notebook/)

Model Training: Train fair and baseline models, export best to model/

Bias Detection: Audit group fairness using Fairlearn

Mitigation: Apply and compare bias mitigation strategies

Deployment: Streamlit app loads model/scaler, visualizes everything

Manual & Bulk Scoring: Score new applicants and full datasets interactively
